# FieldTracer XR

## Overview
FieldTracer XR is a proprietary project developed under the Human-Machine Perception Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. This module is designed for Humphrey visual field testing in Unreal Engine 5 and Vive Pro Eye VR headset environment and is initially focused on the basic 20/40 test. The project is funded by NASA grants and is part of a larger effort to enhance clinical diagnosis and understanding of vestibulo-ocular diseases.

## Current Focus
The current development stage is centered on implementing the basic 20/40 visual field test with plans to expand the project's scope in future updates.

## Features (Planned)
- **Extended Reality Visual Field Assessment**: Employing XR technology for a comprehensive visual field testing experience.
- **Advanced Eye-Tracking**: Integrating top-tier eye-tracking technology to enhance test accuracy.
- **Simulation of Patient Perception**: Aiding clinicians in understanding diseases from the patient's viewpoint.
- **Astronaut Vision Assessment**: Part of a broader NASA-funded initiative to monitor astronaut vision in space.

## Installation
Setup and installation instructions will be provided as the project advances.

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5
- Vive Pro Eye VR headset
- Further requirements will be updated accordingly.

### Setup
Details regarding the setup process will be made available upon completion of the basic 20/40 test implementation.

## Contributing
Given the proprietary nature of FieldTracer XR, contributions are currently limited to team members of the Human-Machine Perception Lab at UNR. However, collaboration inquiries are welcome.
