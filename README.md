# VisionScopePro

## Overview
VisionScopePro is an extended reality (XR) project developed under the Human-Machine Perception Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. This comprehensive module integrates multiple ophthalmic diagnostic tests, including visual field assessment (PeriMapXR), automated pupil testing (RAPD), full-field stimulus threshold, cone contrast testing, the Amsler Grid, and the Ishihara color test. The system is designed for Pico 4 Enterprise headsets and utilizes advanced eye-tracking and patient tracking to provide a robust framework for vision screening and diagnostic procedures.

## Purpose
VisionScopePro aims to advance ophthalmic diagnosis and vision screening through the utilization of XR technology. This project supports global vision screening initiatives, offering an accessible and cost-effective solution for early detection of vision problems, particularly in underserved regions.

### Key Objectives:
- **Comprehensive Vision Screening**: XR-based tests, including visual field thresholding, contrast sensitivity, and color vision assessments.
- **Patient Monitoring**: Built-in patient tracking system for longitudinal data collection and analysis.
- **Advanced Eye-Tracking**: Real-time eye movement analysis during testing for enhanced accuracy.
- **Ophthalmic Diagnosis**: Designed to aid in diagnosing conditions such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy.

## Features
- **PeriMapXR**: A Humphrey visual field testing module adapted for Pico 4E, part of VisionScopePro's comprehensive test suite.
- **RAPD: Rapid Automated Pupil Test**: An updated pupil reflex and response test designed for XR environments.
- **Cone Contrast Test**: Assesses color discrimination ability using advanced stimulus presentation.
- **Amsler Grid**: An interactive grid for detecting macular defects.
- **Ishihara Test**: Color vision testing based on Ishihara plates.
- **Full-Field Stimulus Threshold**: Assesses vision sensitivity across the full visual field.
- **Patient Tracking System**: Facilitates continuous monitoring of patients across multiple tests for research and diagnosis.

## Installation
Setup and installation instructions are in progress. VisionScopePro will require the following components for installation:

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5
- Pico 4 Enterprise headset
- Pico Unreal Plugins
- Additional hardware or software requirements will be provided in the final release.

### Setup
Detailed instructions for setting up VisionScopePro will be available upon the project's next development milestone.
