# PeriMapXR

## Overview
PeriMapXR is a proprietary project developed under the Human-Machine Perception Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. This module is designed for automated perimetry (visual field) testing within the Pico 4 Enterprise environment using Unreal Engine 5. The project is funded by NASA and is part of a broader effort to enhance clinical diagnostics and research into vestibulo-ocular diseases.

## Current Focus
The current development stage is focused on refining the implementation of the basic 20/40 visual field test. Future updates will extend the scope of the project with additional functionality and testing capabilities.

## Features (Planned)
- **Extended Reality Visual Field Assessment**: Utilizing XR technology for a fully immersive visual field testing experience.
- **Advanced Eye-Tracking Integration**: Incorporating advanced eye-tracking for improved accuracy in test results.
- **Simulation of Patient Perception**: Enabling clinicians to visualize and understand patient experiences with vision loss.
- **Astronaut Vision Assessment**: A key part of NASAâ€™s initiative to monitor astronaut vision health during space missions.

## Installation
Instructions for setup and installation will be provided as the project advances.

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5
- Pico 4 Enterprise headset
- Additional requirements will be updated as development progresses.

### Setup
Details for configuring and running PeriMapXR will be made available once the core features of the 20/40 test are finalized.

## Contributing
Due to the proprietary nature of PeriMapXR, contributions are currently limited to authorized team members within the Human-Machine Perception Lab at UNR. However, we welcome inquiries for collaboration.
